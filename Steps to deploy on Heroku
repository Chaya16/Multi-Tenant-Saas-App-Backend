Ensure that GOPATH variable has been set

Ensure that $GOPATH/bin has been added to your $PATH

Make sure that your git repository contains Procfile in which the following conten is there- web:application, where web specifies that 
web application will run, and application is the name of the command to be executed which is your git repo name 
and can be found in GOPATH/bin

To avoid any PORT related errors when deploying you app on heroku include the following code snippet:
var port = os.Getenv("PORT")
	// Set a default port if there is nothing in the environment
	if port == "" {
		port = "8080"
		fmt.Println("INFO: No PORT environment variable detected, defaulting to " + port)
	}

Install Godeps

For including any dependicies in your code do: go get "dependency path".
Then execute godep save

Download Heroku CLI

Execute command "heroku login" and enter your login credentials

Assuming that you are in the root directory of the application which is located inside of your $GOPATH execute the following commands:
  * go get github.com/name of your git repository
  * heroku create -b https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go.git
  * git push heroku master
  * if the above command shows some error like repository does not exist or cannot deploy to this repository, then use 
    git remote set-url heroku  "name of app that came when heroku create command is executed"
  * heroku open to open your app
  * heroku ps to see the process status
  * heroku logs --tail to see the logs for your app
